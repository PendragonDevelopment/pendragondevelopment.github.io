## If you can't do something smart, do something right.

This is where I'm supposed to talk about myself, right? Feels a little self indulgent, but okay. Interspersed with my words there will be quotes from books, TV shows, and movies that I try to apply to my life. Try to keep up.

First and foremost, I am, and will always be, the optimist. Hoper of far-flung hopes, and the dreamer of improbable dreams. I routinely bite off more than I can chew and give too much of myself away. Sometimes this bites me in the ass, but most of the time it's completely worth it.

I enjoy building things: communities, technology, emergency survival plans. I try to see my life as an RPG, where everything I do levels up some attribute of mine. Life's just more fun that way.

Want to know more about me? That's weird. But sure, that's what this blog is here for, theoretically. You can also find more professional substance over on my company blog at [Vitamin C](https://getvitaminc.com) or short ramblings on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/PendragonDev).
